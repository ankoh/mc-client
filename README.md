## Mendeley Cache Client
This project aims to build an Angular.js client for the [Mendeley Cache Server](https://github.com/ankoh/mendeley-cache-server)

**This project is currently under heavy development.**


### Contribution
We use a [GitLab Server](https://gitlab.kohn.io/ankoh/mendeley-cache-client) bundled with [GitLab CI](https://gitlab-ci.kohn.io/projects/16) for continuous builds and deployments.

Feel free to contribute as soon as the software reaches a certain level of professionality.

**Attention: At the moment both servers use self-signed SSL certificates.**


### Tests
We will use Selenium Protractor tests.


### Deployment
Will be based on Docker and npm.
